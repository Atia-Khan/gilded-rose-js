# Gilded Rose Kata

## Background

The Gilded Rose is a famous kata (or exercise) in OO, testing, and refactoring legacy code. By completing this kata, you will master the proper use of inheritance, by using it to eliminate conditionals in a wide-but-not-deep tree.

## Instructions

- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) by Sandi Metz.
- Fork & clone this repository
- Use IntelliJ's code coverage tool to write tests that increase coverage to **100%**
- Refactor, following the example set by Ms. Metz
- Verify the tests still pass

***Make sure you do not touch the 40 line if statement!***

At 10:28 in the video, Ms. Metz talks about how to create "a seam". Follow this procedure to avoid having to understand the deeply nested conditionals.

### Run with Coverage

Use IntelliJ's run with coverage feature:

Observe the red lines of code and turn them green!
